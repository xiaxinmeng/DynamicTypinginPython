+.SS ☤ Importing from requirements.txt
 .sp
 If you only have a \fBrequirements.txt\fP file available when running \fBpipenv install\fP,
 pipenv will automatically import the contents of this file and create a \fBPipfile\fP for you.
 .sp
 You can also specify \fB$ pipenv install \-r path/to/requirements.txt\fP to import a requirements file.
 .sp
-Note, that when importing a requirements file, they often have version numbers pinned, which you likely won\(aqt want
-in your \fBPipfile\fP, so you\(aqll have to manually update your \fBPipfile\fP afterwards to reflect this.
+If your requirements file has version numbers pinned, you\(aqll likely want to edit the new \fBPipfile\fP
+to remove those, and let \fBpipenv\fP keep track of pinning.  If you want to keep the pinned versions
+in your \fBPipfile.lock\fP for now, run \fBpipenv lock \-\-keep\-outdated\fP\&.  Make sure to
+\fI\%upgrade\fP soon!
 .SS ☤ Specifying Versions of a Package
 .sp
-To tell pipenv to install a specific version of a library, the usage is simple:
+You can specify versions of a package using the \fI\%Semantic Versioning scheme\fP
+(i.e. \fBmajor.minor.micro\fP).
+.sp
+For example, to install requests you can use:
 .INDENT 0.0
 .INDENT 3.5
 .sp
 .nf
 .ft C
-$ pipenv install requests==2.13.0
+$ pipenv install requests~=1.2   # equivalent to requests~=1.2.0
 .ft P
 .fi
 .UNINDENT
 .UNINDENT
 .sp
+Pipenv will install version \fB1.2\fP and any minor update, but not \fB2.0\fP\&.
+.sp
 This will update your \fBPipfile\fP to reflect this requirement, automatically.
+.sp
+In general, Pipenv uses the same specifier format as pip. However, note that according to \fI\%PEP 440\fP , you can\(aqt use versions containing a hyphen or a plus sign.
+.sp
+To make inclusive or exclusive version comparisons you can use:
+.INDENT 0.0
+.INDENT 3.5
+.sp
+.nf
+.ft C
+$ pipenv install "requests>=1.4"   # will install a version equal or larger than 1.4.0
+$ pipenv install "requests<=2.13"  # will install a version equal or lower than 2.13.0
+$ pipenv install "requests>2.19"   # will install 2.19.1 but not 2.19.0

+The use of \fB" "\fP around the package and version specification is highly recommended
+to avoid issues with \fI\%Input and output redirection\fP
+in Unix\-based operating systems.
+.UNINDENT
+.UNINDENT
+.sp
+The use of \fB~=\fP is preferred over the \fB==\fP identifier as the former prevents pipenv from updating the packages:
+.INDENT 0.0
+.INDENT 3.5

+.nf
+.ft C
+$ pipenv install "requests~=2.2"  # locks the major version of the package (this is equivalent to using ==2.*)

To avoid version conflicts in subdependencies of different libraries within a project, libraries should never ever pin dependency versions. Although they may specify lower or (less frequently) upper bounds, if they rely on some specific feature/fix/bug. Library dependencies are specified via \fBinstall_requires\fP in \fBsetup.py\fP\&.
+.sp
+Libraries are ultimately meant to be used in some \fBapplication\fP\&. Applications are different in that they usually are not depended on by other projects. They are meant to be deployed into some specific environment and only then should the exact versions of all their dependencies and subdependencies be made concrete. To make this process easier is currently the main goal of Pipenv.
+.sp
+To summarize:
+.INDENT 0.0
+.IP \(bu 2
+For libraries, define \fBabstract dependencies\fP via \fBinstall_requires\fP in \fBsetup.py\fP\&. The decision of which version exactly to be installed and where to obtain that dependency is not yours to make!
+.IP \(bu 2
+For applications, define \fBdependencies and where to get them\fP in the \fIPipfile\fP and use this file to update the set of \fBconcrete dependencies\fP in \fBPipfile.lock\fP\&. This file defines a specific idempotent environment that is known to work for your project. The \fBPipfile.lock\fP is your source of truth. The \fBPipfile\fP is a convenience for you to create that lock\-file, in that it allows you to still remain somewhat vague about the exact version of a dependency to be used. Pipenv is there to help you define a working conflict\-free set of specific dependency\-versions, which would otherwise be a very tedious task.
+.IP \(bu 2
+Of course, \fBPipfile\fP and Pipenv are still useful for library developers, as they can be used to define a development or test environment.
+.IP \(bu 2
+And, of course, there are projects for which the distinction between library and application isn\(aqt that clear. In that case, use \fBinstall_requires\fP alongside Pipenv and \fBPipfile\fP\&.
+.UNINDENT
+.sp
+You can also do this:
+.INDENT 0.0
+.INDENT 3.5
+.sp
+.nf
+.ft C
+$ pipenv install \-e .
+.ft P
+.fi
+.UNINDENT
+.UNINDENT
+.sp
+This will tell Pipenv to lock all your \fBsetup.py\fP–declared dependencies.
+.SS ☤ Changing Pipenv\(aqs Cache Location
+.sp
+You can force Pipenv to use a different cache location by setting the environment variable \fBPIPENV_CACHE_DIR\fP to the location you wish. This is useful in the same situations that you would change \fBPIP_CACHE_DIR\fP to a different directory.
+.SS ☤ Changing Default Python Versions
+.sp
+By default, Pipenv will initialize a project using whatever version of python the python3 is. Besides starting a project with the \fB\-\-three\fP or \fB\-\-two\fP flags, you can also use \fBPIPENV_DEFAULT_PYTHON_VERSION\fP to specify what version to use when starting a project when \fB\-\-three\fP or \fB\-\-two\fP aren\(aqt used.
+.SS Frequently Encountered Pipenv Problems
+.sp
+Pipenv is constantly being improved by volunteers, but is still a very young
+project with limited resources, and has some quirks that needs to be dealt
+with. We need everyone’s help (including yours!).
+.sp
+Here are some common questions people have using Pipenv. Please take a look
+below and see if they resolve your problem.
+.sp
+\fBNOTE:\fP
+.INDENT 0.0
+.INDENT 3.5
+\fBMake sure you’re running the newest Pipenv version first!\fP
+.UNINDENT
+.UNINDENT
+.SS ☤ Your dependencies could not be resolved
+.sp
+Make sure your dependencies actually \fIdo\fP resolve. If you’re confident they
+are, you may need to clear your resolver cache. Run the following command:
+.INDENT 0.0
+.INDENT 3.5
+.sp
+.nf
+.ft C
+pipenv lock \-\-clear
+.ft P
+.fi
+.UNINDENT
+.UNINDENT
+.sp
+and try again.
+.sp
+If this does not work, try manually deleting the whole cache directory. It is
+usually one of the following locations:
+.INDENT 0.0
+.IP \(bu 2
+\fB~/Library/Caches/pipenv\fP (macOS)
+.IP \(bu 2
+\fB%LOCALAPPDATA%\epipenv\epipenv\eCache\fP (Windows)
+.IP \(bu 2
+\fB~/.cache/pipenv\fP (other operating systems)
+.UNINDENT
+.sp
+Pipenv does not install prereleases (i.e. a version with an alpha/beta/etc.
+suffix, such as \fI1.0b1\fP) by default. You will need to pass the \fB\-\-pre\fP flag
+in your command, or set
+.INDENT 0.0
+.INDENT 3.5
+.sp
+.nf
+.ft C
+[pipenv]
+allow_prereleases = true
+.ft P
+.fi
+.UNINDENT
+.UNINDENT
+.sp
+in your Pipfile.
+.SS ☤ No module named <module name>
+.sp
+This is usually a result of mixing Pipenv with system packages. We \fIstrongly\fP
+recommend installing Pipenv in an isolated environment. Uninstall all existing
+Pipenv installations, and see installing\-pipenv to choose one of the
+recommended way to install Pipenv instead.
+.SS ☤ My pyenv\-installed Python is not found
+.sp
+Make sure you have \fBPYENV_ROOT\fP set correctly. Pipenv only supports CPython
+distributions, with version name like \fB3.6.4\fP or similar.
+.SS ☤ Pipenv does not respect pyenv’s global and local Python versions
+.sp
+Pipenv by default uses the Python it is installed against to create the
+virtualenv. You can set the \fB\-\-python\fP option, or
+\fB$PYENV_ROOT/shims/python\fP to let it consult pyenv when choosing the
+interpreter. See specifying_versions for more information.
+.sp
+If you want Pipenv to automatically “do the right thing”, you can set the
+environment variable \fBPIPENV_PYTHON\fP to \fB$PYENV_ROOT/shims/python\fP\&. This
+will make Pipenv use pyenv’s active Python version to create virtual
+environments by default.
+.SS ☤ ValueError: unknown locale: UTF\-8
+.sp
+macOS has a bug in its locale detection that prevents us from detecting your
+shell encoding correctly. This can also be an issue on other systems if the
+locale variables do not specify an encoding.
+.sp
+The workaround is to set the following two environment variables to a standard
+localization format:
+.INDENT 0.0
+.IP \(bu 2
+\fBLC_ALL\fP
+.IP \(bu 2
+\fBLANG\fP
+.UNINDENT

+For Bash, for example, you can add the following to your \fB~/.bash_profile\fP:
+.INDENT 0.0
+.INDENT 3.5
+.sp
+.nf
+.ft C
+export LC_ALL=\(aqen_US.UTF\-8\(aq
+export LANG=\(aqen_US.UTF\-8\(aq

+.sp
+For Zsh, the file to edit is \fB~/.zshrc\fP\&.
+.sp
+\fBNOTE:\fP
+.INDENT 0.0
+.INDENT 3.5
+You can change both the \fBen_US\fP and \fBUTF\-8\fP part to the
+language/locale and encoding you use.
+.UNINDENT
+.UNINDENT
+.SS ☤ /bin/pip: No such file or directory
+.sp
+This may be related to your locale setting. See \fI\%☤ ValueError: unknown locale: UTF\-8\fP
+for a possible solution.
+.SS ☤ \fBshell\fP does not show the virtualenv’s name in prompt
+.sp
+This is intentional. You can do it yourself with either shell plugins, or
+clever \fBPS1\fP configuration. If you really want it back, use
+.INDENT 0.0
+.INDENT 3.5
+.sp
+.nf
+.ft C
+pipenv shell \-c
+.ft P
+.fi
+.UNINDENT
+.UNINDENT
+.sp
+instead (not available on Windows).
+.SS ☤ Pipenv does not respect dependencies in setup.py
+.sp
+No, it does not, intentionally. Pipfile and setup.py serve different purposes,
+and should not consider each other by default. See pipfile\-vs\-setuppy
+for more information.
+.SS ☤ Using \fBpipenv run\fP in Supervisor program
+.sp
+When you configure a supervisor program\(aqs \fBcommand\fP with \fBpipenv run ...\fP, you
+need to set locale enviroment variables properly to make it work.
+.sp
+Add this line under \fB[supervisord]\fP section in \fB/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf\fP:
+.INDENT 0.0
+.INDENT 3.5
+.sp
+.nf
+.ft C
+[supervisord]
+environment=LC_ALL=\(aqen_US.UTF\-8\(aq,LANG=\(aqen_US.UTF\-8\(aq
+.ft P
+.fi
+.UNINDENT
+.UNINDENT
+.SS ☤ An exception is raised during \fBLocking dependencies…\fP
+.sp
+Run \fBpipenv lock \-\-clear\fP and try again. The lock sequence caches results
+to speed up subsequent runs. The cache may contain faulty results if a bug
+causes the format to corrupt, even after the bug is fixed. \fB\-\-clear\fP flushes
+the cache, and therefore removes the bad results.

+.SS Contributing to Pipenv
+.sp
+If you\(aqre reading this, you\(aqre probably interested in contributing to Pipenv.
+Thank you very much! Open source projects live\-and\-die based on the support
+they receive from others, and the fact that you\(aqre even considering
+contributing to the Pipenv project is \fIvery\fP generous of you.
+.sp
+This document lays out guidelines and advice for contributing to this project.
+If you\(aqre thinking of contributing, please start by reading this document and
+getting a feel for how contributing to this project works. If you have any
+questions, feel free to reach out to either \fI\%Dan Ryan\fP, \fI\%Tzu\-ping Chung\fP,
+or \fI\%Nate Prewitt\fP, the primary maintainers.
+.sp
+The guide is split into sections based on the type of contribution you\(aqre
+thinking of making, with a section that covers general guidelines for all
+contributors.
+.SS Be Cordial
+.INDENT 0.0
+.INDENT 3.5
+\fBBe cordial or be on your way\fP\&. \fI—Kenneth Reitz\fP
+.UNINDENT
+.UNINDENT
+.sp
+Pipenv has one very important rule governing all forms of contribution,
+including reporting bugs or requesting features. This golden rule is
+"\fI\%be cordial or be on your way\fP".
+.sp
+\fBAll contributions are welcome\fP, as long as
+everyone involved is treated with respect.
+.SS Get Early Feedback
+.sp
+If you are contributing, do not feel the need to sit on your contribution until
+it is perfectly polished and complete. It helps everyone involved for you to
+seek feedback as early as you possibly can. Submitting an early, unfinished
+version of your contribution for feedback in no way prejudices your chances of
+getting that contribution accepted, and can save you from putting a lot of work
+into a contribution that is not suitable for the project.
+.SS Contribution Suitability
+.sp
+Our project maintainers have the last word on whether or not a contribution is
+suitable for Pipenv. All contributions will be considered carefully, but from
+time to time, contributions will be rejected because they do not suit the
+current goals or needs of the project.
+.sp
+If your contribution is rejected, don\(aqt despair! As long as you followed these
+guidelines, you will have a much better chance of getting your next
+contribution accepted.
+.SS Code Contributions
+.SS Steps for Submitting Code
+.sp
+When contributing code, you\(aqll want to follow this checklist:
+.INDENT 0.0
+.IP 1. 3
+Fork the repository on GitHub.
+.IP 2. 3
+\fI\%Run the tests\fP to confirm they all pass on your system. If they don\(aqt, you\(aqll
+need to investigate why they fail. If you\(aqre unable to diagnose this
+yourself, raise it as a bug report by following the guidelines in this
+document: \fI\%Bug Reports\fP\&.
+.IP 3. 3
+Write tests that demonstrate your bug or feature. Ensure that they fail.
+.IP 4. 3
+Make your change.
+.IP 5. 3
+Run the entire test suite again, confirming that all tests pass \fIincluding
+the ones you just added\fP\&.
+.IP 6. 3
+Send a GitHub Pull Request to the main repository\(aqs \fBmaster\fP branch.
+GitHub Pull Requests are the expected method of code collaboration on this
+project.
+.UNINDENT
+.sp
+The following sub\-sections go into more detail on some of the points above.
+.SS Code Review
+.sp
+Contributions will not be merged until they\(aqve been code reviewed. You should
+implement any code review feedback unless you strongly object to it. In the
+event that you object to the code review feedback, you should make your case
+clearly and calmly. If, after doing so, the feedback is judged to still apply,
+you must either apply the feedback or withdraw your contribution.
+.SS Documentation Contributions
+.sp
+Documentation improvements are always welcome! The documentation files live in
+the \fBdocs/\fP directory of the codebase. They\(aqre written in
+\fI\%reStructuredText\fP, and use \fI\%Sphinx\fP to generate the full suite of
+documentation.
+.sp
+When contributing documentation, please do your best to follow the style of the
+documentation files. This means a soft\-limit of 79 characters wide in your text
+files and a semi\-formal, yet friendly and approachable, prose style.
+.sp
+When presenting Python code, use single\-quoted strings (\fB\(aqhello\(aq\fP instead of
+\fB"hello"\fP).
+.SS Bug Reports
+.sp
+Bug reports are hugely important! Before you raise one, though, please check
+through the \fI\%GitHub issues\fP, \fBboth open and closed\fP, to confirm that the bug
+hasn\(aqt been reported before. Duplicate bug reports are a huge drain on the time
+of other contributors, and should be avoided as much as possible.
+.SS Run the tests
+.sp
+Three ways of running the tests are as follows:
+.INDENT 0.0
+.IP 1. 3
+\fBmake test\fP (which uses \fBdocker\fP)
+.IP 2. 3
+\fB\&./run\-tests.sh\fP or \fBrun\-tests.bat\fP
