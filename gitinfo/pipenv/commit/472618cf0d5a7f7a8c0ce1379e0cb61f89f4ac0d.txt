+2020.5.28 (2020-05-28)
+======================
+
+Features & Improvements
+-----------------------
+
+- ``pipenv install`` and ``pipenv sync`` will no longer attempt to install satisfied dependencies during installation.  `#3057 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3057>`_,
+  `#3506 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3506>`_
+- Added support for resolution of direct-url dependencies in ``setup.py`` files to respect ``PEP-508`` style URL dependencies.  `#3148 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3148>`_
+- Added full support for resolution of all dependency types including direct URLs, zip archives, tarballs, etc.
+
+  - Improved error handling and formatting.
+
+  - Introduced improved cross platform stream wrappers for better ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` consistency.  `#3298 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3298>`_
+- For consistency with other commands and the ``--dev`` option
+  description, ``pipenv lock --requirements --dev`` now emits
+  both default and development dependencies.
+  The new ``--dev-only`` option requests the previous
+  behaviour (e.g. to generate a ``dev-requirements.txt`` file).  `#3316 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3316>`_
+- Pipenv will now successfully recursively lock VCS sub-dependencies.  `#3328 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3328>`_
+- Added support for ``--verbose`` output to ``pipenv run``.  `#3348 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3348>`_
+- Pipenv will now discover and resolve the intrinsic dependencies of **all** VCS dependencies, whether they are editable or not, to prevent resolution conflicts.  `#3368 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3368>`_
+- Added a new environment variable, ``PIPENV_RESOLVE_VCS``, to toggle dependency resolution off for non-editable VCS, file, and URL based dependencies.  `#3577 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3577>`_
+- Added the ability for Windows users to enable emojis by setting ``PIPENV_HIDE_EMOJIS=0``.  `#3595 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3595>`_
+- Allow overriding PIPENV_INSTALL_TIMEOUT environment variable (in seconds).  `#3652 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3652>`_
+- Allow overriding PIP_EXISTS_ACTION evironment variable (value is passed to pip install). 
+  Possible values here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip/#exists-action-option
+  Useful when you need to `PIP_EXISTS_ACTION=i` (ignore existing packages) - great for CI environments, where you need really fast setup.  `#3738 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3738>`_
+- Pipenv will no longer forcibly override ``PIP_NO_DEPS`` on all vcs and file dependencies as resolution happens on these in a pre-lock step.  `#3763 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3763>`_
+- Improved verbose logging output during ``pipenv lock`` will now stream output to the console while maintaining a spinner.  `#3810 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3810>`_
+- Added support for automatic python installs via ``asdf`` and associated ``PIPENV_DONT_USE_ASDF`` environment variable.  `#4018 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4018>`_
+- Pyenv/asdf can now be used whether or not they are available on PATH. Setting PYENV_ROOT/ASDF_DIR in a Pipenv's .env allows Pipenv to install an interpreter without any shell customizations, so long as pyenv/asdf is installed.  `#4245 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4245>`_
+- Added ``--key`` command line parameter for including personal PyUp.io API tokens when running ``pipenv check``.  `#4257 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4257>`_
+
+Behavior Changes
+----------------
+
+- Make conservative checks of known exceptions when subprocess returns output, so user won't see the whole traceback - just the error.  `#2553 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2553>`_
+- Do not touch Pipfile early and rely on it so that one can do ``pipenv sync`` without a Pipfile.  `#3386 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3386>`_
+- Re-enable ``--help`` option for ``pipenv run`` command.  `#3844 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3844>`_
+- Make sure ``pipenv lock -r --pypi-mirror {MIRROR_URL}`` will respect the pypi-mirror in requirements output.  `#4199 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4199>`_
+
