+A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
+==========================
+
+Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
+Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
+as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
+principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
+
+In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
+National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
+in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
+software.
+
+In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
+BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
+year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
+Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
+https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
+created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
+Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.
+
+All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
+the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
+releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
+the various releases.
+
+    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
+                    from                                compatible? (1)
+
+    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
+    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes

+    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
+    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
+    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
+    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes
+
+Footnotes:
+
+(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
+    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
+    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
+    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
+    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
+
+(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
+    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
+    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
+    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
+
+Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
+direction to make these releases possible.

+
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
+
+   1. Definitions.
+
+      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
+      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
+
+      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
+      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
+
+      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
+      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
+      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
+      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
+      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
+      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
+      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
+
+      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
+      exercising permissions granted by this License.
+
+      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
+      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
+      source, and configuration files.
+
+      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+      and conversions to other media types.
+
+      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
+      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
+      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
+      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
+      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
+      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
+      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
+      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
+      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
+      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
+      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+
+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that You changed the files; and
+
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
+

+
+A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
+==========================
+
+Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
+Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
+as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
+principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
+
+In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
+National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
+in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
+software.
+
+In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
+BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
+year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
+Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
+Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
+non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
+Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
+the PSF.
+
+All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
+the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
+releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
+the various releases.

+Footnotes:
+
+(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
+    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
+    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
+    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
+    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
+
+(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
+    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
+    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
+    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
+
+Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
+direction to make these releases possible.
