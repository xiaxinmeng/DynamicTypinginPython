commit c5f37f6bd63072a672616d680845e2f77aa00066
Author: Pilou <pierre-louis@libregerbil.fr>
Date:   Wed Aug 8 06:48:03 2018 +0200

    improve 'service' integration tests (#43655)
    
    * service tests: check that daemon is really running
    
    (spoiler: it isn't)
    
    * service tests: add PIDFile directive in systemd unit
    
    * service tests: check 'changed' too
    
    * service tests: fix indentation & use changed test
    
    * service tests: #16694 has been fixed a long time ago
    
    * service tests: refactor
    
    - always execute cleaning tasks
    - move tests tasks in a dedicated file
    
    * service tests: add test for #42786
    
    * service tests: display value of ansible_service_mgr
    
    * service tests: allow to run tests twice in a row
    
    stop & disable ansible test service
    
    * service tests: 'pattern' value must be a substring
    
    'pattern' parameter is poorly named
    
    * service tests: check ansible_test service status
    
    * service tests: test daemon must handle SIGHUP
    
    because 'initctl reload' sends SIGHUP, otherwise test daemon stops when
    receiving the signal
    
    * service tests: remove upstart override file too
    
    and check that files were removed using raw module and stat command
