-      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
-      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
-
-      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
-      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
-      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
-      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
-      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

-      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

-      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
-      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
-      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
-      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
-      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-      as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
-      meet the following conditions:
-
-      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
-          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
-
-      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
-          stating that You changed the files; and

-      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
-          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
-          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
-          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-          the Derivative Works; and
-
-      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
-          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-          as modifying the License.
-
-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-      the conditions stated in this License.
-
-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/twitter/bootstrap.png)](http://travis-ci.org/twitter/bootstrap)
-=================
-
-Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development, created and maintained by [Mark Otto](http://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thornton](http://twitter.com/fat) at Twitter.
-
-To get started, checkout http://getbootstrap.com!
-
-
-
-Quick start
------------
-
-Clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/twitter/bootstrap.git`, or [download the latest release](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/zipball/master).
-
-
-
-Versioning
-----------
-
-For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.
-
-Releases will be numbered with the following format:
-
-`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
-
-And constructed with the following guidelines:
-
-* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
-* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
-* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
-
-For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.
-
-
-
-Bug tracker
------------

-We have included a makefile with convenience methods for working with the Bootstrap library.
-
-+ **dependencies**
-Our makefile depends on you having recess, connect, uglify.js, and jshint installed. To install, just run the following command in npm:
-
-```
-$ npm install recess connect uglify-js jshint -g
-```
-
-+ **build** - `make`
-Runs the recess compiler to rebuild the `/less` files and compiles the docs pages. Requires recess and uglify-js. <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/less.html#compiling">Read more in our docs &raquo;</a>
-
-+ **test** - `make test`
-Runs jshint and qunit tests headlessly in [phantomjs](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/) (used for ci). Depends on having phantomjs installed.
-
-+ **watch** - `make watch`
-This is a convenience method for watching just Less files and automatically building them whenever you save. Requires the Watchr gem.
-

-## 2.0 BOOTSTRAP JS PHILOSOPHY
-These are the high-level design rules which guide the development of Bootstrap's plugin apis.
-
----
-
-### DATA-ATTRIBUTE API
-
-We believe you should be able to use all plugins provided by Bootstrap purely through the markup API without writing a single line of javascript.
-
-We acknowledge that this isn't always the most performant and sometimes it may be desirable to turn this functionality off altogether. Therefore, as of 2.0 we provide the ability to disable the data attribute API by unbinding all events on the body namespaced with `'data-api'`. This looks like this:
-
-    $('body').off('.data-api')
-
-To target a specific plugin, just include the plugins name as a namespace along with the data-api namespace like this:
-
-    $('body').off('.alert.data-api')
-
----
-
-### PROGRAMATIC API
-
-We also believe you should be able to use all plugins provided by Bootstrap purely through the JS API.
-
-All public APIs should be single, chainable methods, and return the collection acted upon.
-
-    $(".btn.danger").button("toggle").addClass("fat")
-
-All methods should accept an optional options object, a string which targets a particular method, or null which initiates the default behavior:
-
-    $("#myModal").modal() // initialized with defaults
-    $("#myModal").modal({ keyboard: false }) // initialized with now keyboard
-    $("#myModal").modal('show') // initializes and invokes show immediately afterqwe2
-
----
-
-### OPTIONS
-
-Options should be sparse and add universal value. We should pick the right defaults.
-
-All plugins should have a default object which can be modified to effect all instance's default options. The defaults object should be available via `$.fn.plugin.defaults`.
-
-    $.fn.modal.defaults = { … }
-
-An options definition should take the following form:
-
-    *noun*: *adjective* - describes or modifies a quality of an instance
-
-examples:
-
-    backdrop: true
-    keyboard: false
-    placement: 'top'
-
----
-
-### EVENTS
-
-All events should have an infinitive and past participle form. The infinitive is fired just before an action takes place, the past participle on completion of the action.
-
-    show | shown
-    hide | hidden
-
----
-
-### CONSTRUCTORS
-
-Each plugin should expose it's raw constructor on a `Constructor` property -- accessed in the following way:
-
-
-    $.fn.popover.Constructor
-
----
-
-### DATA ACCESSOR
-
-Each plugin stores a copy of the invoked class on an object. This class instance can be accessed directly through jQuery's data API like this:
-
-    $('[rel=popover]').data('popover') instanceof $.fn.popover.Constructor
-
----
-
-### DATA ATTRIBUTES
-
-Data attributes should take the following form:
-
-- data-{{verb}}={{plugin}} - defines main interaction
-- data-target || href^=# - defined on "control" element (if element controls an element other than self)
-- data-{{noun}} - defines class instance options
-
-examples:
-
-    // control other targets
-    data-toggle="modal" data-target="#foo"
-    data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#foo" data-parent="#bar"
-
-    // defined on element they control
-    data-spy="scroll"
-
-    data-dismiss="modal"
-    data-dismiss="alert"
-
-    data-toggle="dropdown"
-
-    data-toggle="button"
-    data-toggle="buttons-checkbox"
-    data-toggle="buttons-radio"

This is applied to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and all paragraphs. In addition, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> (paragraphs) receive a bottom margin of half their line-height (10px by default).</p>

-          <p>The typographic scale is based on two LESS variables in <strong>variables.less</strong>: <code>@baseFontSize</code> and <code>@baseLineHeight</code>. The first is the base font-size used throughout and the second is the base line-height. We use those variables and some simple math to create the margins, paddings, and line-heights of all our type and more. Customize them and Bootstrap adapts.</p>

-</pre>
-          <p>
-            <span class="label label-info">Heads up!</span>
-            We use <code>.disabled</code> as a utility class here, similar to the common <code>.active</code> class, so no prefix is required. Also, this class is only for aesthetic; you must use custom JavaScript to disable links here.
-          </p>
-
-          <h3>Button element</h3>
-          <p>Add the <code>disabled</code> attribute to <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> buttons.</p>
-          <p class="bs-docs-example">
-            <button type="button" class="btn btn-large btn-primary disabled" disabled="disabled">Primary button</button>
-            <button type="button" class="btn btn-large" disabled>Button</button>

-&lt;button type="button" class="btn btn-large" disabled&gt;Button&lt;/button&gt;
-</pre>
-
-
-          <h2>One class, multiple tags</h2>
-          <p>Use the <code>.btn</code> class on an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element.</p>
-          <form class="bs-docs-example">
-            <a class="btn" href="">Link</a>
-            <button class="btn" type="submit">Button</button>
-            <input class="btn" type="button" value="Input">
-            <input class="btn" type="submit" value="Submit">
-          </form>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-&lt;a class="btn" href=""&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;
-&lt;button class="btn" type="submit"&gt;Button&lt;/button&gt;
-&lt;input class="btn" type="button" value="Input"&gt;
-&lt;input class="btn" type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;
-</pre>
-          <p>As a best practice, try to match the element for your context to ensure matching cross-browser rendering. If you have an <code>input</code>, use an <code>&lt;input type="submit"&gt;</code> for your button.</p>

-          <h2>How to use</h2>
-          <p>All icons require an <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag with a unique class, prefixed with <code>icon-</code>. To use, place the following code just about anywhere:</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-&lt;i class="icon-search"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
-</pre>
-          <p>There are also styles available for inverted (white) icons, made ready with one extra class. We will specifically enforce this class on hover and active states for nav and dropdown links.</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-&lt;i class="icon-search icon-white"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
-</pre>
-          <p>
-            <span class="label label-info">Heads up!</span>
-            When using beside strings of text, as in buttons or nav links, be sure to leave a space after the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag for proper spacing.

-          <p>Toggleable, contextual menu for displaying lists of links. Made interactive with the <a href="./javascript.html#dropdowns">dropdown javascript plugin</a>.</p>

-&lt;/ul&gt;
-</pre>
-
-          <h2>Markup</h2>
-          <p>Looking at just the dropdown menu, here's the required HTML. You need to wrap the dropdown's trigger and the dropdown menu within <code>.dropdown</code>, or another element that declares <code>position: relative;</code>. Then just create the menu.</p>
-
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-&lt;div class="dropdown"&gt;
-  &lt;!-- Link or button to toggle dropdown --&gt;
-  &lt;ul class="dropdown-menu" role="menu" aria-labelledby="dLabel"&gt;
-    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a tabindex="-1" href="#"&gt;Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
-    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a tabindex="-1" href="#"&gt;Another action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
-    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a tabindex="-1" href="#"&gt;Something else here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
-    &lt;li class="divider"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
-    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a tabindex="-1" href="#"&gt;Separated link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;/ul&gt;
-&lt;/div&gt;
-</pre>
-
-          <h2>Options</h2>
-          <p>Align menus to the right and add include additional levels of dropdowns.</p>
-
-          <h3>Aligning the menus</h3>
-          <p>Add <code>.pull-right</code> to a <code>.dropdown-menu</code> to right align the dropdown menu.</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-&lt;ul class="dropdown-menu pull-right" role="menu" aria-labelledby="dLabel"&gt;
-  ...
-&lt;/ul&gt;
-</pre>
-
-          <h3>Sub menus on dropdowns</h3>
-          <p>Add an extra level of dropdown menus, appearing on hover like those of OS X, with some simple markup additions. Add <code>.dropdown-submenu</code> to any <code>li</code> in an existing dropdown menu for automatic styling.</p>

-          <p>Combine sets of <code>&lt;div class="btn-group"&gt;</code> into a <code>&lt;div class="btn-toolbar"&gt;</code> for more complex components.</p>

-          <h4>Checkbox and radio flavors</h4>
-          <p>Button groups can also function as radios, where only one button may be active, or checkboxes, where any number of buttons may be active. View <a href="./javascript.html#buttons">the Javascript docs</a> for that.</p>
-

-          <p><span class="label label-info">Heads up!</span> Buttons with dropdowns must be individually wrapped in their own <code>.btn-group</code> within a <code>.btn-toolbar</code> for proper rendering.</p>

-          <p>In some cases&mdash;like mobile&mdash;dropdown menus will extend outside the viewport. You need to resolve the alignment manually or with custom javascript.</p>

-&lt;/ul&gt;
-</pre>
-
-          <h3>Basic pills</h3>
-          <p>Take that same HTML, but use <code>.nav-pills</code> instead:</p>
-          <div class="bs-docs-example">
-            <ul class="nav nav-pills">

-&lt;/ul&gt;
-</pre>
-
-          <h3>Disabled state</h3>
-          <p>For any nav component (tabs, pills, or list), add <code>.disabled</code> for <strong>gray links and no hover effects</strong>. Links will remain clickable, however, unless custom javascript is implemented to prevent those clicks.</p>
-          <div class="bs-docs-example">
-            <ul class="nav nav-pills">
-              <li><a href="#">Clickable link</a></li>

-  ...
-&lt;/ul&gt;
-</pre>
-
-          <h3>Component alignment</h3>
-          <p>To align nav links, use the <code>.pull-left</code> or <code>.pull-right</code> utility classes. Both classes will add a CSS float in the specified direction.</p>
-
-
-          <hr class="bs-docs-separator">
-
-
-          <h2>Stackable</h2>
-          <p>As tabs and pills are horizontal by default, just add a second class, <code>.nav-stacked</code>, to make them appear vertically stacked.</p>

-          <h3>Stacked tabs</h3>

-          <h2>Pager</h2>
-          <p>Quick previous and next links for simple pagination implementations with light markup and styles. It's great for simple sites like blogs or magazines.</p>

-
-          <h3>Aligned links</h3>
-          <p>Alternatively, you can align each link to the sides:</p>

-    &lt;a href="#"&gt;Newer &amp;rarr;&lt;/a&gt;
-  &lt;/li&gt;
-&lt;/ul&gt;
-</pre>
-
-          <h3>Optional disabled state</h3>
-          <p>Pager links also use the general <code>.disabled</code> utility class from the pagination.</p>
-          <div class="bs-docs-example">

-          <h3>Why use thumbnails</h3>
-          <p>Thumbnails (previously <code>.media-grid</code> up until v1.4) are great for grids of photos or videos, image search results, retail products, portfolios, and much more. They can be links or static content.</p>
-
-          <h3>Simple, flexible markup</h3>
-          <p>Thumbnail markup is simple&mdash;a <code>ul</code> with any number of <code>li</code> elements is all that is required. It's also super flexible, allowing for any type of content with just a bit more markup to wrap your contents.</p>
-
-          <h3>Uses grid column sizes</h3>
-          <p>Lastly, the thumbnails component uses existing grid system classes&mdash;like <code>.span2</code> or <code>.span3</code>&mdash;for control of thumbnail dimensions.</p>
-
-          <h2>Markup</h2>
-          <p>As mentioned previously, the required markup for thumbnails is light and straightforward. Here's a look at the default setup <strong>for linked images</strong>:</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-&lt;ul class="thumbnails"&gt;
-  &lt;li class="span4"&gt;
-    &lt;a href="#" class="thumbnail"&gt;
-      &lt;img src="http://placehold.it/300x200" alt=""&gt;
-    &lt;/a&gt;
-  &lt;/li&gt;
-  ...
-&lt;/ul&gt;
-</pre>
-          <p>For custom HTML content in thumbnails, the markup changes slightly. To allow block level content anywhere, we swap the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> like so:</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-&lt;ul class="thumbnails"&gt;
-  &lt;li class="span4"&gt;
-    &lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;
-      &lt;img src="http://placehold.it/300x200" alt=""&gt;
-      &lt;h3&gt;Thumbnail label&lt;/h3&gt;
-      &lt;p&gt;Thumbnail caption...&lt;/p&gt;
-    &lt;/div&gt;
-  &lt;/li&gt;
-  ...
-&lt;/ul&gt;
-</pre>
-
-          <h2>More examples</h2>
-          <p>Explore all your options with the various grid classes available to you. You can also mix and match different sizes.</p>
-          <ul class="thumbnails">
-            <li class="span4">
-              <a href="#" class="thumbnail">

-          <h3>Dismiss buttons</h3>
-          <p>Mobile Safari and Mobile Opera browsers, in addition to the <code>data-dismiss="alert"</code> attribute, require an <code>href="#"</code> for the dismissal of alerts when using an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.</p>
-          <pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;a href="#" class="close" data-dismiss="alert"&gt;&times;&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
-          <p>Alternatively, you may use a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element with the data attribute, which we have opted to do for our docs. When using <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, you must include <code>type="button"</code> or your forms may not submit.</p>
-          <pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert"&gt;&times;&lt;/button&gt;</pre>

-          <p class="lead">Bootstrap is made with LESS at its core, a dynamic stylesheet language created by our good friend, <a href="http://cloudhead.io">Alexis Sellier</a>. It makes developing systems-based CSS faster, easier, and more fun.</p>
-
-          <h3>Why LESS?</h3>
-          <p>One of Bootstrap's creators wrote a quick <a href="http://www.wordsbyf.at/2012/03/08/why-less/">blog post about this</a>, summarized here:</p>
-          <ul>
-            <li>Bootstrap compiles faster ~6x faster with Less compared to Sass</li>
-            <li>Less is written in JavaScript, making it easier to us to dive in and patch compared to Ruby with Sass.</li>
-            <li>Less is more; we want to feel like we're writing CSS and making Bootstrap approachable to all.</li>
-          </ul>
-
-          <h3>What's included?</h3>
-          <p>As an extension of CSS, LESS includes variables, mixins for reusable snippets of code, operations for simple math, nesting, and even color functions.</p>
-
-          <h3>Learn more</h3>

-        ================================================== -->

-          <div class="page-header">
-            <h1>Compiling Bootstrap with Less</h1>
-          </div>
-
-          <p class="lead">Since our CSS is written with Less and utilizes variables and mixins, it needs to be compiled for final production implementation. Here's how.</p>
-
-          <div class="alert alert-info">
-            <strong>Note:</strong> If you're submitting a pull request to GitHub with modified CSS, you <strong>must</strong> recompile the CSS via any of these methods.
-          </div>
-
-          <h2>Tools for compiling</h2>
-
-          <h3>Node with makefile</h3>
-          <p>Install the LESS command line compiler, JSHint, Recess, and uglify-js globally with npm by running the following command:</p>
-          <pre>$ npm install -g less jshint recess uglify-js</pre>
-          <p>Once installed just run <code>make</code> from the root of your bootstrap directory and you're all set.</p>
-          <p>Additionally, if you have <a href="https://github.com/mynyml/watchr">watchr</a> installed, you may run <code>make watch</code> to have bootstrap automatically rebuilt every time you edit a file in the bootstrap lib (this isn't required, just a convenience method).</p>
-
-          <h3>Command line</h3>
-          <p>Install the LESS command line tool via Node and run the following command:</p>
-          <pre>$ lessc ./less/bootstrap.less > bootstrap.css</pre>
-          <p>Be sure to include <code>--compress</code> in that command if you're trying to save some bytes!</p>
-
-          <h3>Javascript</h3>
-          <p><a href="http://lesscss.org/">Download the latest Less.js</a> and include the path to it (and Bootstrap) in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint">
-&lt;link rel="stylesheet/less" href="/path/to/bootstrap.less"&gt;
-&lt;script src="/path/to/less.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
-</pre>
-          <p>To recompile the .less files, just save them and reload your page. Less.js compiles them and stores them in local storage.</p>

-          <p>This is the most basic form of Bootstrap: compiled files for quick drop-in usage in nearly any web project. We provide compiled CSS and JS (<code>bootstrap.*</code>), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (<code>bootstrap.min.*</code>). The image files are compressed using <a href="http://imageoptim.com/">ImageOptim</a>, a Mac app for compressing PNGs.</p>
-          <p>Please note that all JavaScript plugins require jQuery to be included.</p>

-          <h4><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/scaffolding.html">Scaffolding</a></h4>

-          <p>Styles for common HTML elements like typography, code, tables, forms, and buttons. Also includes <a href="http://glyphicons.com">Glyphicons</a>, a great little icon set.</p>
-          <h4><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html">Components</a></h4>
-          <p>Basic styles for common interface components like tabs and pills, navbar, alerts, page headers, and more.</p>
-          <h4><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html">Javascript plugins</a></h4>
-          <p>Similar to Components, these Javascript plugins are interactive components for things like tooltips, popovers, modals, and more.</p>
-
-          <h2>List of components</h2>
-          <p>Together, the <strong>Components</strong> and <strong>Javascript plugins</strong> sections provide the following interface elements:</p>
-          <ul>
-            <li>Button groups</li>
-            <li>Button dropdowns</li>
-            <li>Navigational tabs, pills, and lists</li>

-            <li>Typeahead</li>
-          </ul>
-          <p>In future guides, we may walk through these components individually in more detail. Until then, look for each of these in the documentation for information on how to utilize and customize them.</p>

-        <!-- HTML template
-        ================================================== -->
-        <section id="html-template">
-          <div class="page-header">
-            <h1>4. Basic HTML template</h1>
-          </div>
-          <p class="lead">With a brief intro into the contents out of the way, we can focus putting Bootstrap to use. To do that, we'll utilize a basic HTML template that includes everything we mentioned in the <a href="#file-structure">File structure</a>.</p>
-          <p>Now, here's a look at a <strong>typical HTML file</strong>:</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
-&lt;html&gt;
-  &lt;head&gt;
-    &lt;title&gt;Bootstrap 101 Template&lt;/title&gt;
-  &lt;/head&gt;
-  &lt;body&gt;
-    &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
-    &lt;script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
-  &lt;/body&gt;
-&lt;/html&gt;
-</pre>
-          <p>To make this <strong>a Bootstrapped template</strong>, just include the appropriate CSS and JS files:</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
-&lt;html&gt;
-  &lt;head&gt;
-    &lt;title&gt;Bootstrap 101 Template&lt;/title&gt;
-    &lt;!-- Bootstrap --&gt;
-    &lt;link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
-  &lt;/head&gt;
-  &lt;body&gt;
-    &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
-    &lt;script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
-    &lt;script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
-  &lt;/body&gt;
-&lt;/html&gt;
-</pre>
-          <p><strong>And you're set!</strong> With those two files added, you can begin to develop any site or application with Bootstrap.</p>

-            <h1>JavaScript in Bootstrap</h1>
-          </div>
-
-          <h3>Individual or compiled</h3>
-          <p>If you have downloaded the latest version of Bootstrap, both <strong>bootstrap.js</strong> and <strong>bootstrap.min.js</strong> contain all of the plugins listed on this page.</p>
-
-          <h3>Data attributes</h3>
-          <p>You can use all Bootstrap plugins purely through the markup API without writing a single line of JavaScript. This is Bootstrap's first class API and should be your first consideration when using a plugin.</p>
-
-          <p>That said, in some situations it may be desirable to turn this functionality off. Therefore, we also provide the ability to disable the data attribute API by unbinding all events on the body namespaced with `'data-api'`. This looks like this:
-          <pre class="prettyprint linenums">$('body').off('.data-api')</pre>
-
-          <p>Alternatively, to target a specific plugin, just include the plugins name as a namespace along with the data-api namespace like this:</p>
-          <pre class="prettyprint linenums">$('body').off('.alert.data-api')</pre>
-
-          <h3>Programmatic API</h3>
-          <p>We also believe you should be able to use all Bootstrap plugins purely through the JavaScript API. All public APIs are single, chainable methods, and return the collection acted upon.</p>
-          <pre class="prettyprint linenums">$(".btn.danger").button("toggle").addClass("fat")</pre>
-          <p>All methods should accept an optional options object, a string which targets a particular method, or nothing (which initiates a plugin with default behavior):</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-$("#myModal").modal()                       // initialized with defaults
-$("#myModal").modal({ keyboard: false })   // initialized with no keyboard
-$("#myModal").modal('show')                // initializes and invokes show immediately</p>
-</pre>
-          <p>Each plugin also exposes it's raw constructor on a `Constructor` property: <code>$.fn.popover.Constructor</code>. If you'd like to get a particular plugin instance, retrieve it directly from an element: <code>$('[rel=popover]').data('popover')</code>.</p>
-
-          <h3>Events</h3>
-          <p>Bootstrap provides custom events for most plugin's unique actions. Generally, these come in an infinitive and past participle form - where the infinitive (ex. <code>show</code>) is triggered at the start of an event, and it's past participle form (ex. <code>shown</code>) is trigger on the completion of an action.</p>
-          <p>All infinitive events provide preventDefault functionality. This provides the abililty to stop the execution of an action before it starts.</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-$('#myModal').on('show', function (e) {
-    if (!data) return e.preventDefault() // stops modal from being shown
-})
-</pre>

-          <h3>About transitions</h3>
-          <p>For simple transition effects, include bootstrap-transition.js once alongside the other JS files. If you're using the compiled (or minified) bootstrap.js, there is no need to include this&mdash;it's already there.</p>
-          <h3>Use cases</h3>
-          <p>A few examples of the transition plugin:</p>
-          <ul>
-            <li>Sliding or fading in modals</li>
-            <li>Fading out tabs</li>
-            <li>Fading out alerts</li>
-            <li>Sliding carousel panes</li>

-          <h2>Usage</h2>
-
-          <h3>Via data attributes</h3>
-          <p>Activate a modal without writing JavaScript. Set <code>data-toggle="modal"</code> on a controller element, like a button, along with a <code>data-target="#foo"</code> or <code>href="#foo"</code> to target a specific modal to toggle.</p>
-          <pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;button type="button" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal"&gt;Launch modal&lt;/button&gt;</pre>
-
-          <h3>Via JavaScript</h3>
-          <p>Call a modal with id <code>myModal</code> with a single line of JavaScript:</p>
-          <pre class="prettyprint linenums">$('#myModal').modal(options)</pre>
-
-          <h3>Options</h3>
-          <p>Options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to <code>data-</code>, as in <code>data-backdrop=""</code>.</p>

-          <h2>Usage</h2>
-
-          <h3>Via data attributes</h3>
-          <p>To easily add scrollspy behavior to your topbar navigation, just add <code>data-spy="scroll"</code> to the element you want to spy on (most typically this would be the body) and <code>data-target=".navbar"</code> to select which nav to use. You'll want to use scrollspy with a <code>.nav</code> component.</p>
-          <pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;body data-spy="scroll" data-target=".navbar"&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;</pre>
-
-          <h3>Via JavaScript</h3>
-          <p>Call the scrollspy via JavaScript:</p>
-          <pre class="prettyprint linenums">$('#navbar').scrollspy()</pre>
-
-          <div class="alert alert-info">
-            <strong>Heads up!</strong>
-            Navbar links must have resolvable id targets. For example, a <code>&lt;a href="#home"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;</code> must correspond to something in the dom like <code>&lt;div id="home"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
-          </div>
-
-          <h3>Methods</h3>
-          <h4>.scrollspy('refresh')</h4>
-          <p>When using scrollspy in conjunction with adding or removing of elements from the DOM, you'll need to call the refresh method like so:</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-$('[data-spy="scroll"]').each(function () {
-  var $spy = $(this).scrollspy('refresh')
-});
-</pre>
-
-          <h3>Options</h3>
-          <p>Options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to <code>data-</code>, as in <code>data-offset=""</code>.</p>

-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-$('#myTab a').click(function (e) {
-  e.preventDefault();

-})</pre>
-          <p>You can activate individual tabs in several ways:</p>

-
-          <h3>Markup</h3>
-          <p>You can activate a tab or pill navigation without writing any JavaScript by simply specifying <code>data-toggle="tab"</code> or <code>data-toggle="pill"</code> on an element. Adding the <code>nav</code> and <code>nav-tabs</code> classes to the tab <code>ul</code> will apply the Bootstrap tab styling.</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">

-            <h2>Usage</h2>
-
-            <h3>Via data attributes</h3>
-            <p>Just add <code>data-toggle="collapse"</code> and a <code>data-target</code> to element to automatically assign control of a collapsible element. The <code>data-target</code> attribute accepts a css selector to apply the collapse to. Be sure to add the class <code>collapse</code> to the collapsible element. If you'd like it to default open, add the additional class <code>in</code>.</p>
-            <p>To add accordion-like group management to a collapsible control, add the data attribute <code>data-parent="#selector"</code>. Refer to the demo to see this in action.</p>
-
-            <h3>Via JavaScript</h3>
-            <p>Enable manually with:</p>
-            <pre class="prettyprint linenums">$(".collapse").collapse()</pre>
-
-            <h3>Options</h3>
-            <p>Options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to <code>data-</code>, as in <code>data-parent=""</code>.</p>

-
-            <hr class="bs-docs-separator">
-
-            <h2>Usage</h2>
-
-            <h3>Via data attributes</h3>
-            <p>To easily add affix behavior to any element, just add <code>data-spy="affix"</code> to the element you want to spy on. Then use offsets to define when to toggle the pinning of an element on and off.</p>
-
-            <pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;div data-spy="affix" data-offset-top="200"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
-
-            <div class="alert alert-info">
-              <strong>Heads up!</strong>
-              You must manage the position of a pinned element and the behavior of its immediate parent. Position is controlled by <code>affix</code>, <code>affix-top</code>, and <code>affix-bottom</code>. Remember to check for a potentially collapsed parent when the affix kicks in as it's removing content from the normal flow of the page.
-            </div>
-
-            <h3>Via JavaScript</h3>
-            <p>Call the affix plugin via JavaScript:</p>
-            <pre class="prettyprint linenums">$('#navbar').affix()</pre>
-
-            <h3>Methods</h3>
-            <h4>.affix('refresh')</h4>
-            <p>When using affix in conjunction with adding or removing of elements from the DOM, you'll want to call the refresh method:</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-$('[data-spy="affix"]').each(function () {
-  $(this).affix('refresh')
-});
-</pre>
-          <h3>Options</h3>
-          <p>Options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to <code>data-</code>, as in <code>data-offset-top="200"</code>.</p>
-          <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">

-          <h3>Requires HTML5 doctype</h3>
-          <p>Bootstrap makes use of certain HTML elements and CSS properties that require the use of the HTML5 doctype. Include it at the beginning of all your projects.</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
-&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
-  ...
-&lt;/html&gt;
-</pre>
-
-          <h3>Typography and links</h3>
-          <p>Bootstrap sets basic global display, typography, and link styles. Specifically, we:</p>
-          <ul>
-            <li>Remove <code>margin</code> on the body</li>
-            <li>Set <code>background-color: white;</code> on the <code>body</code></li>
-            <li>Use the <code>@baseFontFamily</code>, <code>@baseFontSize</code>, and <code>@baseLineHeight</code> attributes as our typographic base</li>
-            <li>Set the global link color via <code>@linkColor</code> and apply link underlines only on <code>:hover</code></li>
-          </ul>
-          <p>These styles can be found within <strong>scaffolding.less</strong>.</p>
-
-          <h3>Reset via Normalize</h3>
-          <p>With Bootstrap 2, the old reset block has been dropped in favor of <a href="http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/" target="_blank">Normalize.css</a>, a project by <a href="http://twitter.com/necolas" target="_blank">Nicolas Gallagher</a> that also powers the <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com" target="_blank">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>. While we use much of Normalize within our <strong>reset.less</strong>, we have removed some elements specifically for Bootstrap.</p>

With the responsive CSS file added, the grid adapts to be 724px and 1170px wide depending on your viewport. Below 767px viewports, the columns become fluid and stack vertically.</p>

-          <h3>Basic grid HTML</h3>
-          <p>For a simple two column layout, create a <code>.row</code> and add the appropriate number of <code>.span*</code> columns. As this is a 12-column grid, each <code>.span*</code> spans a number of those 12 columns, and should always add up to 12 for each row (or the number of columns in the parent).</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-&lt;div class="row"&gt;
-  &lt;div class="span4"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
-  &lt;div class="span8"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
-&lt;/div&gt;
-</pre>
-          <p>Given this example, we have <code>.span4</code> and <code>.span8</code>, making for 12 total columns and a complete row.</p>
-
-          <h2>Offsetting columns</h2>
-          <p>Move columns to the right using <code>.offset*</code> classes. Each class increases the left margin of a column by a whole column. For example, <code>.offset4</code> moves <code>.span4</code> over four columns.</p>

-            <div class="row show-grid">

-
-          <h2>Nesting columns</h2>
-          <p>To nest your content with the default grid, add a new <code>.row</code> and set of <code>.span*</code> columns within an existing <code>.span*</code> column. Nested rows should include a set of columns that add up to the number of columns of its parent.</p>

-
-          <h2>Live fluid grid example</h2>
-          <p>The fluid grid system uses percents instead of pixels for column widths. It has the same responsive capabilities as our fixed grid system, ensuring proper proportions for key screen resolutions and devices.</p>
-          <div class="bs-docs-grid">
-            <div class="row-fluid show-grid">

-          </div>
-
-          <h3>Basic fluid grid HTML</h3>
-          <p>Make any row "fluid" by changing <code>.row</code> to <code>.row-fluid</code>. The column classes stay the exact same, making it easy to flip between fixed and fluid grids.</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-&lt;div class="row-fluid"&gt;
-  &lt;div class="span4"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
-  &lt;div class="span8"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
-&lt;/div&gt;
-</pre>
-
-          <h2>Fluid offsetting</h2>
-          <p>Operates the same way as the fixed grid system offsetting: add <code>.offset*</code> to any column to offset by that many columns.</p>
-          <div class="bs-docs-grid">
-            <div class="row-fluid show-grid">
-              <div class="span4">4</div>
-              <div class="span4 offset4">4 offset 4</div>
-            </div><!-- /row -->
-            <div class="row-fluid show-grid">
-              <div class="span3 offset3">3 offset 3</div>
-              <div class="span3 offset3">3 offset 3</div>
-            </div><!-- /row -->
-            <div class="row-fluid show-grid">
-              <div class="span6 offset6">6 offset 6</div>

-  &lt;div class="span4"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
-  &lt;div class="span4 offset2"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
-&lt;/div&gt;
-</pre>
-
-          <h2>Fluid nesting</h2>
-          <p>Nesting with fluid grids is a bit different: the number of nested columns should not match the parent's number of columns. Instead, each level of nested columns are reset because each row takes up 100% of the parent column.</p>

-          <p>Turn on responsive CSS in your project by including the proper meta tag and additional stylesheet within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your document. If you've compiled Bootstrap from the Customize page, you need only include the meta tag.</p>

-&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
-&lt;link href="assets/css/bootstrap-responsive.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
-</pre>
-          <p><span class="label label-info">Heads up!</span>  Bootstrap doesn't include responsive features by default at this time as not everything needs to be responsive. Instead of encouraging developers to remove this feature, we figure it best to enable it as needed.</p>
-
-          <h2>About responsive Bootstrap</h2>
-          <img src="assets/img/responsive-illustrations.png" alt="Responsive devices" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;">
-          <p>Media queries allow for custom CSS based on a number of conditions&mdash;ratios, widths, display type, etc&mdash;but usually focuses around <code>min-width</code> and <code>max-width</code>.</p>
-          <ul>
-            <li>Modify the width of column in our grid</li>
-            <li>Stack elements instead of float wherever necessary</li>
-            <li>Resize headings and text to be more appropriate for devices</li>
-          </ul>
-          <p>Use media queries responsibly and only as a start to your mobile audiences. For larger projects, do consider dedicated code bases and not layers of media queries.</p>
-
-          <h2>Supported devices</h2>
-          <p>Bootstrap supports a handful of media queries in a single file to help make your projects more appropriate on different devices and screen resolutions. Here's what's included:</p>

-          <h3>{{_i}}Why use thumbnails{{/i}}</h3>
-          <p>{{_i}}Thumbnails (previously <code>.media-grid</code> up until v1.4) are great for grids of photos or videos, image search results, retail products, portfolios, and much more. They can be links or static content.{{/i}}</p>
-
-          <h3>{{_i}}Simple, flexible markup{{/i}}</h3>
-          <p>{{_i}}Thumbnail markup is simple&mdash;a <code>ul</code> with any number of <code>li</code> elements is all that is required. It's also super flexible, allowing for any type of content with just a bit more markup to wrap your contents.{{/i}}</p>
-
-          <h3>{{_i}}Uses grid column sizes{{/i}}</h3>
-          <p>{{_i}}Lastly, the thumbnails component uses existing grid system classes&mdash;like <code>.span2</code> or <code>.span3</code>&mdash;for control of thumbnail dimensions.{{/i}}</p>
-
-          <h2>{{_i}}Markup{{/i}}</h2>
-          <p>{{_i}}As mentioned previously, the required markup for thumbnails is light and straightforward. Here's a look at the default setup <strong>for linked images</strong>:{{/i}}</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-&lt;ul class="thumbnails"&gt;
-  &lt;li class="span4"&gt;
-    &lt;a href="#" class="thumbnail"&gt;
-      &lt;img src="http://placehold.it/300x200" alt=""&gt;
-    &lt;/a&gt;
-  &lt;/li&gt;
-  ...
-&lt;/ul&gt;
-</pre>
-          <p>{{_i}}For custom HTML content in thumbnails, the markup changes slightly. To allow block level content anywhere, we swap the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> like so:{{/i}}</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-&lt;ul class="thumbnails"&gt;
-  &lt;li class="span4"&gt;
-    &lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;
-      &lt;img src="http://placehold.it/300x200" alt=""&gt;
-      &lt;h3&gt;{{_i}}Thumbnail label{{/i}}&lt;/h3&gt;

-            <h1>{{_i}}JavaScript in Bootstrap{{/i}}</h1>
-          </div>
-
-          <h3>{{_i}}Individual or compiled{{/i}}</h3>
-          <p>{{_i}}If you have downloaded the latest version of Bootstrap, both <strong>bootstrap.js</strong> and <strong>bootstrap.min.js</strong> contain all of the plugins listed on this page.{{/i}}</p>
-
-          <h3>{{_i}}Data attributes{{/i}}</h3>
-          <p>{{_i}}You can use all Bootstrap plugins purely through the markup API without writing a single line of JavaScript. This is Bootstrap's first class API and should be your first consideration when using a plugin.{{/i}}</p>
-
-          <p>{{_i}}That said, in some situations it may be desirable to turn this functionality off. Therefore, we also provide the ability to disable the data attribute API by unbinding all events on the body namespaced with `'data-api'`. This looks like this:{{/i}}
-          <pre class="prettyprint linenums">$('body').off('.data-api')</pre>
-
-          <p>{{_i}}Alternatively, to target a specific plugin, just include the plugins name as a namespace along with the data-api namespace like this:{{/i}}</p>
-          <pre class="prettyprint linenums">$('body').off('.alert.data-api')</pre>
-
-          <h3>{{_i}}Programmatic API{{/i}}</h3>
-          <p>{{_i}}We also believe you should be able to use all Bootstrap plugins purely through the JavaScript API. All public APIs are single, chainable methods, and return the collection acted upon.{{/i}}</p>
-          <pre class="prettyprint linenums">$(".btn.danger").button("toggle").addClass("fat")</pre>
-          <p>{{_i}}All methods should accept an optional options object, a string which targets a particular method, or nothing (which initiates a plugin with default behavior):{{/i}}</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-$("#myModal").modal()                       // initialized with defaults
-$("#myModal").modal({ keyboard: false })   // initialized with no keyboard
-$("#myModal").modal('show')                // initializes and invokes show immediately</p>
-</pre>
-          <p>{{_i}}Each plugin also exposes it's raw constructor on a `Constructor` property: <code>$.fn.popover.Constructor</code>. If you'd like to get a particular plugin instance, retrieve it directly from an element: <code>$('[rel=popover]').data('popover')</code>.{{/i}}</p>
-
-          <h3>{{_i}}Events{{/i}}</h3>
-          <p>{{_i}}Bootstrap provides custom events for most plugin's unique actions. Generally, these come in an infinitive and past participle form - where the infinitive (ex. <code>show</code>) is triggered at the start of an event, and it's past participle form (ex. <code>shown</code>) is trigger on the completion of an action.{{/i}}</p>
-          <p>{{_i}}All infinitive events provide preventDefault functionality. This provides the abililty to stop the execution of an action before it starts.{{/i}}</p>
-<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
-$('#myModal').on('show', function (e) {
-    if (!data) return e.preventDefault() // stops modal from being shown
