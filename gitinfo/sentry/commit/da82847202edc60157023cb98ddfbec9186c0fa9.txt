+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+

+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+TWITTER BOOTSTRAP
+=================
+
+Bootstrap is Twitter's toolkit for kickstarting CSS for websites, apps, and more. It includes base CSS styles for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, alerts, and more.
+
+To get started -- checkout http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap!
+
+
+Usage
+-----
+
+You can use Twitter Bootstrap in one of two ways: just drop the compiled CSS into any new project and start cranking, or run LESS on your site and compile on the fly like a boss.
+
+Here's what the LESS version looks like:
+
+``` html
+<link rel="stylesheet/less" type="text/css" href="lib/bootstrap.less">
+<script src="less.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
+```
+
+Or if you prefer, the standard css way:
+
+``` html
+<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="bootstrap.css">
+```
+
+For more info, refer to the docs!
+
+
+Versioning
+----------
+
+For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backwards compatibility, Bootstrap will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.
+
+Releases will be numbered with the follow format:
+
+`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
+
+And constructed with the following guidelines:
+
+* Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major
+* New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor
+* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch
+
+For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.

+Developers
+----------
+
+We have included a makefile with convenience methods for working with the bootstrap library.
+
++ **build** - `make build`
+This will run the less compiler on the bootstrap lib and generate a bootstrap.css and bootstrap.min.css file.
+The lessc compiler is required for this command to run.
+
++ **watch** - `make watch`
+This is a convenience method for watching your less files and automatically building them whenever you save.
+Watchr is required for this command to run.

+@gridColumnWidth:   20px;
+@gridGutterWidth:   20px;</pre>

+      </p>
+    </div>
+    <div class="span12">
+      <h3>When to use</h3>
+      <p>Emphasis tags (<code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>) should be used to indicate additional importance or emphasis of a word or phrase relative to its surrounding copy. Use <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> for importance and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for <em>stress</em> emphasis.</p>
+      <h3>Emphasis in a paragraph</h3>
+      <p><a href="#">Fusce dapibus</a>, <strong>tellus ac cursus commodo</strong>, <em>tortor mauris condimentum nibh</em>, ut fermentum massa justo sit amet risus. Maecenas faucibus mollis interdum. Nulla vitae elit libero, a pharetra augue.</p>
+      <p><strong>Note:</strong> It's still okay to use <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tags in HTML5 and they don't have to be styled bold and italic, respectively (although if there is a more semantic element, use it). <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> is meant to highlight words or phrases without conveying additional importance, while <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> is mostly for voice, technical terms, etc.</p>
+      <h3>Addresses</h3>
+      <p>The <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> element is used for contact information for its nearest ancestor, or the entire body of work. Here are two examples of how it could be used:</p>
+
+      <div class="row">
+        <div class="span4">
+          <address>
+            <strong>Twitter, Inc.</strong><br />

+            <strong>Full Name</strong><br />

+          </address>
+        </div>
+      </div>
+
+      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Each line in an <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> must end with a line-break (<code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>) or be wrapped in a block-level tag (e.g., <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) to properly structure the content.</p>
+      <h3>Abbreviations</h3>
+      <p>For abbreviations and acronyms, use the <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> tag (<code>&lt;acronym&gt;</code> is deprecated in <abbr title="HyperText Markup Langugage 5">HTML5</abbr>). Put the shorthand form within the tag and set a title for the complete name.</p>

+      <h2>Building tables</h2>
+      <p>
+        <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>
+        <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>
+        <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>
+        <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>
+        <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>

+      </p>
+      <p>Tables are great&mdash;for a lot of things. Great tables, however, need a bit of markup love to be useful, scalable, and readable (at the code level). Here are a few tips to help.</p>
+      <p>Always wrap your column headers in a <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> such that hierarchy is <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> > <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> > <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>.</p>
+      <p>Similar to the column headers, all your table’s body content should be wrapped in a <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> so your hierarchy is <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> > <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> > <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>.</p>
+    </div>
+    <div class="span12">
+      <h3>Example: Default table styles</h3>
+      <p>All tables will be automatically styled with only the essential borders to ensure readability and maintain structure. No need to add extra classes or attributes.</p>
+      <table>
+        <thead>
+          <tr>
+            <th>#</th>

+            <th>Language</th>
+          </tr>
+        </thead>
+        <tbody>
+          <tr>
+            <td>1</td>
+            <td>Some</td>
+            <td>One</td>

+      <h3>Example: Condensed table</h3>

+      <h2>Buttons</h2>
+      <p>As a convention, buttons are used for actions while links are used for objects. For instance, "Download" could be a button and "recent activity" could be a link.</p>
+      <p>All buttons default to a light gray style, but a number of functional classes can be applied for different color styles. These classes include a blue <code>.primary</code> class, a light-blue <code>.info</code> class, a green <code>.success</code> class, and a red <code>.danger</code> class.</p>
+    </div>
+    <div class="span12">
+      <h3>Example buttons</h3>
+      <p>Button styles can be applied to anything with the <code>.btn</code> applied. Typically you’ll want to apply these to only <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, and select <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements. Here’s how it looks:</p>
+      <div class="well" style="padding: 14px 19px;">
+        <button class="btn primary">Primary</button>&nbsp;<button class="btn">Default</button>&nbsp;<button class="btn info">Info</button>&nbsp;<button class="btn success">Success</button>&nbsp;<button class="btn danger">Danger</button>
+      </div>
+      <h3>Alternate sizes</h3>
+      <p>Fancy larger or smaller buttons? Have at it!</p>
+      <div class="well">
+        <a href="#" class="btn large primary">Primary action</a>
+        <a href="#" class="btn large">Action</a>
+      </div>
+      <div class="well" style="padding: 16px 19px;">
+        <a href="#" class="btn small primary">Primary action</a>
+        <a href="#" class="btn small">Action</a>
+      </div>
+      <h3>Disabled state</h3>
+      <p>For buttons that are not active or are disabled by the app for one reason or another, use the disabled state. That’s <code>.disabled</code> for links and <code>:disabled</code> for <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements.</p>
+      <h4>Links</h4>
+      <div class="well">
+        <a href="#" class="btn large primary disabled">Primary action</a>

+    </div>
+    <div class="span5">
+      <h4>Customizable</h4>
+      <p>All elements within, and the entire topbar as well, are optional. You can choose to include a logo/name, nav, search, and a secondary nav&mdash;or any combination of that.</p>
+    </div>
+    <div class="span6">
+      <h4>Dropdowns included</h4>
+      <p>As part of the main navigation, we’ve included the ability for you to add dropdowns to your nav. Check out the secondary nav above (right aligned) to see how it’s done. Dropdowns <code>li</code> tags also support <code>.active</code> for showing current page selection.</p>
+    </div>
+  </div>
+  <p><strong>Note:</strong> When using the topbar on any page, be sure to account for the overlap it causes by adding <code>padding-top: 40px;</code> to your <code>body</code>.</p>

+       <h3>Is javascript necessary?</h3>
+       <p><strong>Nope!</strong> Bootstrap is designed first and foremost to be a CSS library. This javascript provides a basic interactive layer on top of the included styles.</p>
+       <p>However, for those who do need javascript, we've provided the plugins above to help you understand how to integrate Bootstrap with javascript and to give you a quick, lightweight option for the basic functionality right away.</p>

+<!-- Using Bootstrap w/ Less
+================================================== -->
+<section id="less">
+<div class="page-header">
+  <h1>Using Bootstrap with Less <small>Supercharge your CSS with variables, mixins, and functions</small></h1>
+</div>
+<div class="row">
+  <div class="span4">
+    <p>Bootstrap was built from <a href="http://markdotto.com/bootstrap/">Preboot</a>, an open-source pack of mixins and variables to be used in conjunction with <a href="http://lesscss.org" target="_blank">Less</a>, a CSS preprocessor for faster and easier web development.</p>
+    <p>Check out how we used Preboot in Bootstrap and how you can make use of it should you choose to run Less on your next project.</p>
+  </div>
+  <div class="span12">
+    <h2>How to use it</h2>
+    <p>Use this option to make full use of Bootstrap’s Less variables, mixins, and nesting in CSS via javascript in your browser.</p>
+<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
+&lt;link rel="stylesheet/less" href="less/bootstrap.less" media="all" /&gt;
+&lt;script src="js/less-1.1.4.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
+<p>Not feeling the .js solution? <a href="http://incident57.com/less" target="_blank">Try the Less Mac app</a> or <a href="http://lesscss.org/#-client-side-usage" target="_blank">use Node.js</a> to compile when you deploy your code.</p>
+
+    <h2>What’s included</h2>
+    <p>Here are some of the highlights of what’s included in Twitter Bootstrap as part of Bootstrap. Head over to the Bootstrap website or Github project page to download and learn more.</p>
+    <h3>Variables</h3>
+    <p>Variables in Less are perfect for maintaining and updating your CSS headache free. When you want to change a color value or a frequently used value, update it in one spot and you’re set.</p>
+<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
+// Links
+@linkColor:         #8b59c2;
+@linkColorHover:    darken(@linkColor, 10);
+
+// Grays
+@black:             #000;
+@grayDark:          lighten(@black, 25%);
+@gray:              lighten(@black, 50%);
+@grayLight:         lighten(@black, 70%);
+@grayLighter:       lighten(@black, 90%);
+@white:             #fff;
+
+// Accent Colors
+@blue:              #08b5fb;
+@green:             #46a546;
+@red:               #9d261d;
+@yellow:            #ffc40d;
+@orange:            #f89406;
+@pink:              #c3325f;
+@purple:            #7a43b6;
+
+// Baseline grid
+@basefont:          13px;
+@baseline:          18px;
+</pre>
+
+<h3>Commenting</h3>
+<p>Less also provides another style of commenting in addition to CSS’s normal <code>/* ... */</code> syntax.</p>
+<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
+// This is a comment
+/* This is also a comment */
+</pre>
+
+<h3>Mixins up the wazoo</h3>
+<p>Mixins are basically includes or partials for CSS, allowing you to combine a block of code into one. They’re great for vendor prefixed properties like <code>box-shadow</code>, cross-browser gradients, font stacks, and more. Below is a sample of the mixins that are included with Bootstrap.</p>
+<h4>Font stacks</h4>
+<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
+#font {
+  .shorthand(@weight: normal, @size: 14px, @lineHeight: 20px) {
+    font-size: @size;
+    font-weight: @weight;
+    line-height: @lineHeight;
+  }
+  .sans-serif(@weight: normal, @size: 14px, @lineHeight: 20px) {
+    font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
+    font-size: @size;
+    font-weight: @weight;
+    line-height: @lineHeight;
+  }
+  ...
+}
+</pre>
+<h4>Gradients</h4>
+<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
+#gradient {
+  ...
+  .vertical (@startColor: #555, @endColor: #333) {
+    background-color: @endColor;
+    background-repeat: repeat-x;
+    background-image: -khtml-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, from(@startColor), to(@endColor)); // Konqueror
+    background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(@startColor, @endColor); // FF 3.6+
+    background-image: -ms-linear-gradient(@startColor, @endColor); // IE10
+    background-image: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, color-stop(0%, @startColor), color-stop(100%, @endColor)); // Safari 4+, Chrome 2+
+    background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(@startColor, @endColor); // Safari 5.1+, Chrome 10+
+    background-image: -o-linear-gradient(@startColor, @endColor); // Opera 11.10
+    background-image: linear-gradient(@startColor, @endColor); // The standard
+  }
+  ...
+}
+</pre>
+
+<h3>Operations</h3>
+<p>Get fancy and perform some math to generate flexible and powerful mixins like the one below.</p>
+<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
+// Griditude
+@gridColumns:       16;
+@gridColumnWidth:   40px;
+@gridGutterWidth:   20px;
+@siteWidth:         (@gridColumns * @gridColumnWidth) + (@gridGutterWidth * (@gridColumns - 1));
+
+// Make some columns
+.columns(@columnSpan: 1) {
+  width: (@gridColumnWidth * @columnSpan) + (@gridGutterWidth * (@columnSpan - 1));
+}
+</pre>
+
+    <h2>Compiling Less</h2>
+    <p>After modifying the <code>.less</code> files in /lib/, you'll need to recompile them in order to regenerate the bootstrap-*.*.*.css and bootstrap-*.*.*.min.css files. If you're submitting a pull request to GitHub, you must always recompile.</p>
+    <h3>Ways to compile</h3>
+    <table class="bordered-table zebra-striped">
+      <thead>
+        <tr>
+          <th style="width: 120px;">Method</th>
+          <th>Steps</th>
+        </tr>
+      </thead>

+        <tr>
+          <td>Node with makefile</td>
+          <td>
+            <p>Install the less command line compiler with npm by running the following command:</p>
+            <pre>$ npm install less</pre>
+            <p>Once installed just run <code>make</code> from the root of your bootstrap directory and you're all set.</p>
+            <p>Additionally, if you have <a href="https://github.com/mynyml/watchr">watchr</a> installed, you may run <code>make watch</code> to have bootstrap automatically rebuilt every time you edit a file in the bootstrap lib (this isn't required, just a convenience method).</p>
+          </td>
+        </tr>
+          <td>Javascript</td>

+&lt;script src="/path/to/less.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
+</pre>
+            <p>To recompile the .less files, just save them and reload your page. Less.js compiles them and stores them in local storage.</p>
+          </td>

+              <pre>$ lessc ./lib/bootstrap.less > bootstrap.css</pre>
+            <p>Be sure to include <code>--compress</code> in that command if you're trying to save some bytes!</p>

+          <p>You can activate modals on your page easily without having to write a single line of javascript. Just give an element a <code>data-controls-modal</code> attribute which corresponds to a modal element id, and when clicked, it will launch your modal. To add modal options, just include them as data attributes as well.</p>
+<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
+&lt;a class="btn" data-controls-modal="my-modal" data-backdrop="static" &gt;Launch Modal&lt;/a&gt;
+</pre>
+          <p><span class="label notice">Notice</span> If you want your modal to animate in and out, just add a <code>.fade</code> class to your <code>.modal</code> element (refer to the demo to see this in action).</p>
+          <h3>Methods</h3>
+          <h4>.modal(options)</h4>
+          <p>Activates your content as a modal. Accepts an optional options <code>object</code>.
+<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
+$('#my-modal').modal({
+  keyboard: true
+})</pre>
+          <h4>.modal('toggle')</h4>

+          <p><span class="label notice">Notice</span> Alternatively, this can be retrieved with <code>$().data('modal')</code>.</p>
