+Spell checking documentation
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+When contributing to documentation to **pandas** it's good to check if your work
+contains any spelling errors. Sphinx provides an easy way to spell check documentation
+and docstrings.
+
+Running the spell check is easy. Just navigate to your local ``pandas/doc/`` directory and run::
+
+    python make.py spellcheck
+
+The spellcheck will take a few minutes to run (between 1 to 6 minutes). Sphinx will alert you
+with warnings and misspelt words - these misspelt words will be added to a file called
+``output.txt`` and you can find it on your local directory ``pandas/doc/build/spelling/``.
+
+The Sphinx spelling extension uses an EN-US dictionary to correct words, what means that in
+some cases you might need to add a word to this dictionary. You can do so by adding the word to
+the bag-of-words file named ``spelling_wordlist.txt`` located in the folder ``pandas/doc/``.

 Fine-grained numpy errstate

-Previous versions of pandas would permanently silence numpy's ufunc error handling when ``pandas`` was imported.

Unfortunately, this silenced legitimate warnings arising in non-pandas code in the application.

 After upgrading pandas, you may see *new* ``RuntimeWarnings`` being issued from your code. These are likely legitimate, and the underlying cause likely existed in the code when using previous versions of pandas that simply silenced the warning. Use `numpy.errstate <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.errstate.html>`__ around the source of the ``RuntimeWarning`` to control how these conditions are handled.
