-## Walkthrough
-
-### Required Packages
-
-First, ensure that you have installed the
-[required packages](../README.md#required-packages) and that the
-[unit tests](../README.md#run-unit-tests) pass.
-
-### Download Kepler Data
-
-A *light curve* is a plot of the brightness of a star over time. We will be
-focusing on light curves produced by the Kepler space telescope, which monitored
-the brightness of 200,000 stars in our milky way galaxy for 4 years. An example
-light curve produced by Kepler is shown below.
-
-![Kepler-934](docs/kepler-943.png)
-
-To train a model to identify planets in Kepler light curves, you will need a
-training set of labeled *Threshold Crossing Events* (TCEs). A TCE is a periodic
-signal that has been detected in a Kepler light curve, and is associated with a
-*period* (the number of days between each occurrence of the detected signal),
-a *duration* (the time taken by each occurrence of the signal), an *epoch* (the
-time of the first observed occurrence of the signal), and possibly additional
-metadata like the signal-to-noise ratio. An example TCE is shown below. The
-labels are ground truth classifications (decided by humans) that indicate which
-TCEs in the training set are actual planets signals and which are caused by
-other phenomena.
-
-![Kepler-934 Transits](docs/kepler-943-transits.png)
-
-You can download the DR24 TCE Table in CSV format from the [NASA Exoplanet
-Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=q1_q17_dr24_tce). Ensure the following columns are selected:
-
-* `rowid`: Integer ID of the row in the TCE table.
-* `kepid`: Kepler ID of the target star.
-* `tce_plnt_num`: TCE number within the target star.
-* `tce_period`: Period of the detected event, in days.
-* `tce_time0bk`: The time corresponding to the center of the first detected
-      event in Barycentric Julian Day (BJD) minus a constant offset of
-      2,454,833.0 days.
-* `tce_duration`: Duration of the detected event, in hours.
-* `av_training_set`: Autovetter training set label; one of PC (planet candidate),
-      AFP (astrophysical false positive), NTP (non-transiting phenomenon),
-      UNK (unknown).
-
-Next, you will need to download the light curves of the stars corresponding to
-the TCEs in the training set. These are available at the
-[Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes](https://archive.stsci.edu/). However,
-you almost certainly don't want all of the Kepler data, which consists of almost
-3 million files, takes up over a terabyte of space, and may take several weeks
-to download! To train our model, we only need to download the subset of light
-curves that are associated with TCEs in the DR24 file. To download just those
-light curves, follow these steps:
-
-**NOTE:** Even though we are only downloading a subset of the entire Kepler
-dataset, the files downloaded by the following script take up about **90 GB**.
-
-```bash
-# Filename containing the CSV file of TCEs in the training set.
-TCE_CSV_FILE="${HOME}/astronet/dr24_tce.csv"
-
-# Directory to download Kepler light curves into.
-KEPLER_DATA_DIR="${HOME}/astronet/kepler/"
-
-# Generate a bash script that downloads the Kepler light curves in the training set.
-python astronet/data/generate_download_script.py \
-  --kepler_csv_file=${TCE_CSV_FILE} \
-  --download_dir=${KEPLER_DATA_DIR}
-
-# Run the download script to download Kepler light curves.
-./get_kepler.sh
-```
-
-The final line should read: `Finished downloading 12669 Kepler targets to
-${KEPLER_DATA_DIR}`
-
-Let's explore the downloaded light curve of the Kepler-90 star! Note that Kepler
-light curves are divided into
-[four quarters each year](https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/data-products.html#kepler-data-release-notes), which are separated by the quarterly rolls that the spacecraft
-made to reorient its solar panels. In the downloaded light curves, each `.fits`
-file corresponds to a specific Kepler quarter, but some quarters are divided
-into multiple `.fits` files.
-
-```python
-# Launch iPython (or Python) from the tensorflow_models/astronet/ directory.
-ipython
-
-In[1]:
-from light_curve import kepler_io
-import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
-import numpy as np
-
-In[2]:
-KEPLER_DATA_DIR = "/path/to/kepler/"
-KEPLER_ID = 11442793  # Kepler-90.
-
-In[3]:
-# Read the light curve.
-file_names = kepler_io.kepler_filenames(KEPLER_DATA_DIR, KEPLER_ID)
-assert file_names, "Failed to find .fits files in {}".format(KEPLER_DATA_DIR)
-all_time, all_flux = kepler_io.read_kepler_light_curve(file_names)
-print("Read light curve with {} segments".format(len(all_time)))
-
-In[4]:
-# Plot the fourth segment.
-plt.plot(all_time[3], all_flux[3], ".")
-plt.show()
-
-In[5]:
-# Plot all light curve segments. We first divide by the median flux in each
-# segment, because the segments are on different scales.
-for f in all_flux:
-  f /= np.median(f)
-plt.plot(np.concatenate(all_time), np.concatenate(all_flux), ".")
-plt.show()
-```
-The output plots should look something like this:
-
-![Kepler 90 Q4](docs/kep90-q4-raw.png)
-
-![Kepler 90 All](docs/kep90-all.png)
-
-The first plot is a single segment of approximately 20 days. You can see a
-planet transit --- that's Kepler-90 g! Also, notice that the brightness of the
-star is not flat over time --- there is natural variation in the brightness,
-even away from the planet transit.
-
-The second plot is the full light curve over the entire Kepler mission
-(aproximately 4 years). You can easily see two transiting planets by eye ---
-they are Kepler-90 h (the biggest known planet in the system with the deepest
-transits) and Kepler-90 g (the second biggest known planet in the system with
-the second deepest transits).
-
-
-### Process Kepler Data
-
-To train a model to identify exoplanets, you will need to provide TensorFlow
-with training data in
-[TFRecord](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/datasets) format. The
-TFRecord format consists of a set of sharded files containing serialized
-`tf.Example` [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).
-
-The command below will generate a set of sharded TFRecord files for the TCEs in
-the training set. Each `tf.Example` proto will contain the following light curve
-representations:
-
-* `global_view`: Vector of length 2001: a "global view" of the TCE.
-* `local_view`: Vector of length 201: a "local view" of the TCE.
-
-In addition, each `tf.Example` will contain the value of each column in the
-input TCE CSV file. The columns include:
-
-* `rowid`: Integer ID of the row in the TCE table.
-* `kepid`: Kepler ID of the target star.
-* `tce_plnt_num`: TCE number within the target star.
-* `av_training_set`: Autovetter training set label.
-* `tce_period`: Period of the detected event, in days.
-
-```bash
-# Use Bazel to create executable Python scripts.
-#
-# Alternatively, since all code is pure Python and does not need to be compiled,
-# we could invoke the source scripts with the following addition to PYTHONPATH:
-#     export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/source/dir/:${PYTHONPATH}"
-bazel build astronet/...
-
-# Directory to save output TFRecord files into.
-TFRECORD_DIR="${HOME}/astronet/tfrecord"
-
-# Preprocess light curves into sharded TFRecord files using 5 worker processes.
-bazel-bin/astronet/data/generate_input_records \
-  --input_tce_csv_file=${TCE_CSV_FILE} \
-  --kepler_data_dir=${KEPLER_DATA_DIR} \
-  --output_dir=${TFRECORD_DIR} \
-  --num_worker_processes=5
-```
-
-When the script finishes you will find 8 training files, 1 validation file and
-1 test file in `TFRECORD_DIR`. The files will match the patterns
-`train-0000?-of-00008`, `val-00000-of-00001` and `test-00000-of-00001`
-respectively.
-
-Here's a quick description of what the script does. For a full description, see
-Section 3 of [our paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aa9e09/meta).
-
-For each light curve, we first fit a normalization spline to remove any
-low-frequency variability (that is, the natural variability in light from star)
-without removing any deviations caused by planets or other objects. For example,
-the following image shows the normalization spline for the segment of Kepler-90
-that we considered above:
-
-![Kepler 90 Q4 Spline](docs/kep90-q4-spline.png)
-
-Next, we divide by the spline to make the star's baseline brightness
-approximately flat. Notice that after normalization the transit of Kepler-90 g
-is still preserved:
-
-![Kepler 90 Q4 Normalized](docs/kep90-q4-normalized.png)
-
-Finally, for each TCE in the input CSV table, we generate two representations of
-the light curve of that star. Both representations are *phase-folded*, which
-means that we combine all periods of the detected TCE into a single curve, with
-the detected event centered.
-
-Let's explore the generated representations of Kepler-90 g in the output.
-
-```python
-# Launch iPython (or Python) from the tensorflow_models/astronet/ directory.
-ipython
-
-In[1]:
-import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
-import numpy as np
-import os.path
-import tensorflow as tf
-
-In[2]:
-KEPLER_ID = 11442793  # Kepler-90
-TFRECORD_DIR = "/path/to/tfrecords/dir"
-
-In[3]:
-# Helper function to find the tf.Example corresponding to a particular TCE.
-def find_tce(kepid, tce_plnt_num, filenames):
-  for filename in filenames:
-    for record in tf.python_io.tf_record_iterator(filename):
-      ex = tf.train.Example.FromString(record)
-      if (ex.features.feature["kepid"].int64_list.value[0] == kepid and
-          ex.features.feature["tce_plnt_num"].int64_list.value[0] == tce_plnt_num):
-        print("Found {}_{} in file {}".format(kepid, tce_plnt_num, filename))
-        return ex
-  raise ValueError("{}_{} not found in files: {}".format(kepid, tce_plnt_num, filenames))
-
-In[4]:
-# Find Kepler-90 g.
-filenames = tf.gfile.Glob(os.path.join(TFRECORD_DIR, "*"))
-assert filenames, "No files found in {}".format(TFRECORD_DIR)
-ex = find_tce(KEPLER_ID, 1, filenames)
-
-In[5]:
-# Plot the global and local views.
-global_view = np.array(ex.features.feature["global_view"].float_list.value)
-local_view = np.array(ex.features.feature["local_view"].float_list.value)
-fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(20, 6))
-axes[0].plot(global_view, ".")
-axes[1].plot(local_view, ".")
-plt.show()
-```
-
-The output should look something like this:
-
-![Kepler 90 g Processed](docs/kep90h-localglobal.png)
-
-### Train an AstroNet Model
-
-This directory contains several types of neural network architecture and various
-configuration options. To train a convolutional neural network to classify
-Kepler TCEs as either "planet" or "not planet", using the best configuration
-from
-[our paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aa9e09/meta),
-run the following training script:
-
-```bash
-# Directory to save model checkpoints into.
-MODEL_DIR="${HOME}/astronet/model/"
-
-# Run the training script.
-bazel-bin/astronet/train \
-  --model=AstroCNNModel \
-  --config_name=local_global \
-  --train_files=${TFRECORD_DIR}/train* \
-  --eval_files=${TFRECORD_DIR}/val* \
-  --model_dir=${MODEL_DIR}
-```
-
-Optionally, you can also run a [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/summaries_and_tensorboard)
-server in a separate process for real-time
-monitoring of training progress and evaluation metrics.
-
-```bash
-# Launch TensorBoard server.
-tensorboard --logdir ${MODEL_DIR}
-```
-
-The TensorBoard server will show a page like this:
-
-![TensorBoard](docs/tensorboard.png)
-
-### Evaluate an AstroNet Model
-
-Run the following command to evaluate a model on the test set. The result will
-be printed on the screen, and a summary file will also be written to the model
-directory, which will be visible in TensorBoard.
-
-```bash
-# Run the evaluation script.
-bazel-bin/astronet/evaluate \
-  --model=AstroCNNModel \
-  --config_name=local_global \
-  --eval_files=${TFRECORD_DIR}/test* \
-  --model_dir=${MODEL_DIR}
-```
-
-The output should look something like this:
-
-```bash
-INFO:tensorflow:Saving dict for global step 10000: accuracy/accuracy = 0.9625159, accuracy/num_correct = 1515.0, auc = 0.988882, confusion_matrix/false_negatives = 10.0, confusion_matrix/false_positives = 49.0, confusion_matrix/true_negatives = 1165.0, confusion_matrix/true_positives = 350.0, global_step = 10000, loss = 0.112445444, losses/weighted_cross_entropy = 0.11295206, num_examples = 1574.
-```
-
-### Make Predictions
-
-Suppose you detect a weak TCE in the light curve of the Kepler-90 star, with
-period 14.44912 days, duration 2.70408 hours (0.11267 days) beginning 2.2 days
-after 12:00 on 1/1/2009 (the year the Kepler telescope launched). To run this
-TCE though your trained model, execute the following command:
-
-```bash
-# Generate a prediction for a new TCE.
-bazel-bin/astronet/predict \
-  --model=AstroCNNModel \
-  --config_name=local_global \
-  --model_dir=${MODEL_DIR} \
-  --kepler_data_dir=${KEPLER_DATA_DIR} \
-  --kepler_id=11442793 \
-  --period=14.44912 \
-  --t0=2.2 \
-  --duration=0.11267 \
-  --output_image_file="${HOME}/astronet/kepler-90i.png"
-```
-
-The output should look like this:
-
-```Prediction: 0.9480018```
-
-This means the model is about 95% confident that the input TCE is a planet.
-Of course, this is only a small step in the overall process of discovering and
-validating an exoplanet: the model’s prediction is not proof one way or the
-other. The process of validating this signal as a real exoplanet requires
-significant follow-up work by an expert astronomer --- see Sections 6.3 and 6.4
-of [our paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aa9e09/meta)
-for the full details. In this particular case, our follow-up analysis validated
-this signal as a bona fide exoplanet: it’s now called
-[Kepler-90 i](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/artificial-intelligence-nasa-data-used-to-discover-eighth-planet-circling-distant-star),
-and is the record-breaking eighth planet discovered around the Kepler-90 star!
-
-In addition to the output prediction, the script will also produce a plot of the
-input representations. For Kepler-90 i, the plot should look something like
-this:

-"""A TensorFlow model for identifying exoplanets in astrophysical light curves.
-
-AstroModel is a concrete base class for models that identify exoplanets in
-astrophysical light curves. This class implements a simple linear model that can
-be extended by subclasses.
-
-The general framework for AstroModel and its subclasses is as follows:
-
-  * Model inputs:
-     - Zero or more time_series_features (e.g. astrophysical light curves)
-     - Zero or more aux_features (e.g. orbital period, transit duration)
-
-  * Labels:
-     - An integer feature with 2 or more values (eg. 0 = Not Planet, 1 = Planet)
-
-  * Model outputs:
-     - The predicted probabilities for each label
-
-  * Architecture:
-
-                         predictions
-                              ^
-                              |
-                           logits
-                              ^
-                              |
-                   (pre_logits_hidden_layers)
-                              ^
-                              |
-                       pre_logits_concat
-                              ^
-                              |
-                        (concatenate)
-                ^                           ^
-                |                           |
-     (time_series_hidden_layers)    (aux_hidden_layers)
-                ^                           ^
-                |                           |
-       time_series_features           aux_features
-
-
-Subclasses will typically override the build_time_series_hidden_layers()
-and/or build_aux_hidden_layers() functions. For example, a subclass could
-override build_time_series_hidden_layers() to apply convolutional layers to the
-time series features. In this class, those functions are simple concatenations
-of the input features.

-r"""Script to preprocesses data from the Kepler space telescope.
-
-This script produces training, validation and test sets of labeled Kepler
-Threshold Crossing Events (TCEs). A TCE is a detected periodic event on a
-particular Kepler target star that may or may not be a transiting planet. Each
-TCE in the output contains local and global views of its light curve; auxiliary
-features such as period and duration; and a label indicating whether the TCE is
-consistent with being a transiting planet. The data sets produced by this script
-can be used to train and evaluate models that classify Kepler TCEs.
-
-The input TCEs and their associated labels are specified by the DR24 TCE Table,
-which can be downloaded in CSV format from the NASA Exoplanet Archive at:
-
-  https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=q1_q17_dr24_tce
-
-The downloaded CSV file should contain at least the following column names:
-  rowid: Integer ID of the row in the TCE table.
-  kepid: Kepler ID of the target star.
-  tce_plnt_num: TCE number within the target star.
-  tce_period: Orbital period of the detected event, in days.
-  tce_time0bk: The time corresponding to the center of the first detected
-      traisit in Barycentric Julian Day (BJD) minus a constant offset of
-      2,454,833.0 days.
-  tce_duration: Duration of the detected transit, in hours.
-  av_training_set: Autovetter training set label; one of PC (planet candidate),
-      AFP (astrophysical false positive), NTP (non-transiting phenomenon),
-      UNK (unknown).
-
-The Kepler light curves can be downloaded from the Mikulski Archive for Space
-Telescopes (MAST) at:
-
-  http://archive.stsci.edu/pub/kepler/lightcurves.
-
-The Kepler data is assumed to reside in a directory with the same structure as
-the MAST archive. Specifically, the file names for a particular Kepler target
-star should have the following format:
-
-    .../${kep_id:0:4}/${kep_id}/kplr${kep_id}-${quarter_prefix}_${type}.fits,
-
-where:
-  kep_id is the Kepler id left-padded with zeros to length 9;
-  quarter_prefix is the file name quarter prefix;
-  type is one of "llc" (long cadence light curve) or "slc" (short cadence light
-    curve).
-
-The output TFRecord file contains one serialized tensorflow.train.Example
-protocol buffer for each TCE in the input CSV file. Each Example contains the
-following light curve representations:
-  global_view: Vector of length 2001; the Global View of the TCE.
-  local_view: Vector of length 201; the Local View of the TCE.
-
-In addition, each Example contains the value of each column in the input TCE CSV
-file. Some of these features may be useful as auxiliary features to the model.
-The columns include:
-  rowid: Integer ID of the row in the TCE table.
-  kepid: Kepler ID of the target star.
-  tce_plnt_num: TCE number within the target star.
-  av_training_set: Autovetter training set label.
-  tce_period: Orbital period of the detected event, in days.
